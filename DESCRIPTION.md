#Walking Tiles

Peter is a builder who is building a path with n tiles of different lengths.
The tiles are represented by 1<= a <sub>i</sub> <=n > where the i is the ith tile. The path is numbered by ports 1, 2, 3...
The tile a <sub>i</sub> can be placed on only the port a <sub>i</sub> th number on the path. for example the tile numbered 1 can be placed on the 1st number of the path. Here the a<sub>i</sub> is i.
Two tiles cannot overlap and length of tiles are varying. What is the maximum tile number that peter can cover .

## INPUT
 The first line contains the number of test cases t.
 The next t lines each contain a test case with first line as n
 The second line contains n integers representing sizes of tiles. 

 ##OUTPUT
 print the max path length covered by peter for each test case in new line.
